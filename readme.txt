I was going crazy trying to think of edge cases that could be handled by calling myFail so I only added edge case handling for "general" edge cases. 

For Q2, this assignment assumes the zip code being inserted is a 5 digit number rather than a 9 digit number/string. For Q2, I created a function that calls the procedure the homework is asking for. This is probably not the intended or "right" way to do it, but its late, im tired and its what I thought of ðŸ˜Ž.
